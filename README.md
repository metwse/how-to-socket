**Note**: You can manage your progress and switch between exercises using the
provided automation scripts. These scripts allow you to work in the workspace/
folder while keeping the repository structure organized.

*Loading an Exercise*: to clear the current workspace and load a specific
solution:
```sh
./load-solution.sh <index.path>
```
**Example**: `./load-solution.sh 00.02.01`

*Saving Your Work*: to persist your current changes in the workspace `src/`
or `tests/` back into the exercise folders:
```sh
./save-solution.sh <index.path>
```
**Example**: `./save-solution.sh 00.00`

The scripts use a shorthand notation (00.02.01) to navigate the numeric
prefixes of the folder structure. You do not need to type the full
descriptive names of the directories.
