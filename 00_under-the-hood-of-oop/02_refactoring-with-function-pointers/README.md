# Refactoring with Function Pointers

## New Requirements
1. Multiple receivers: Messages can now target multiple users/channels
   - Example: `@alice @bob #general Hello everyone!`
   - A single message goes to alice, bob, AND the general channel
2. Bulk commands: Execute multiple commands in one line
   - Example: `/login user pass; join general; status`
   - Commands separated by semicolons, executed sequentially

## Stop! Before You Continue...
**Question:** How would you implement these in your Exercise 01 code?

Think about it for a moment...

---

**The painful reality:**
- You would need to rewrite `push_payload()` parsing logic, completely.
- The `payload_data` union would need a new receiver list structure.
- Multiple switch cases would change to handle arrays instead of single
  values.
- Processing logic would need loops for each receiver.
- Command parsing would need string splitting on semicolons.

In other words: *you would need to touch almost every function*, risking bugs
and spending hours debugging edge cases.

*This is the moment* to ask: *"Is there a better way to organize my code?"*

The answer is **yes**: function pointers.

## The Current Problem
Look at your code from Exercise 01. Notice how every time you want to add a new
payload type, you have to modify code in multiple place*:

1. Add a new enum value to `payload_kind`
2. Add a new struct to the `payload_data` union
3. Add a parsing case in `push_payload()`
4. Add a processing case in `process_next()`
5. Add a cleanup case (if you're properly freeing memory)

This is called tight coupling. Everything is intertwined, one change ripples
through the entire codebase.

### Imagine more Future Requirements
What if we need to add:

- **Timestamps** for each payload?
- **Priority levels** (urgent, normal, low)?
- **Validation** before processing?
- **Logging** when payloads are processed?
- **JSON export** of payloads?
- **Filtering** payloads by type?

With the current design, each feature requires changes in almost all functions.
*This doesn't scale.* Real applications have dozens or hundreds of message
types.

## The Function Pointer Solution
Instead of using switch statements everywhere, we can *store behavior with
data*, recall *function pointers*.

### Core Idea
What if each payload could "know how to process itself"?

```c
// Traditional approach: separate data and behavior
switch (payload->kind) {
    case COMMAND_LOGIN:
        printf("Command: login\n");
        printf("  Arguments: [username: %s, password: %s]\n", ...);
        break;
    // ... more cases
}

// Function pointer approach: behavior stored with data
payload->process(payload);  // Each payload knows how to process itself!
```

## Your Mission
Refactor your Exercise 01 code to use *function pointers* instead of switch
statements.

## Requirements
1. Remove the gigantic `payload_kind` enum:
   - No more type enumeration!
   - Each payload type is self-contained.
2. Add a function pointer to each payload:
   ```c
   struct payload {
       void (*process)(struct payload *self);
       // ... data
   };
   ```
3. Each payload type sets its own processing function:
   - Login command -> uses `process_login()` function
   - Direct message -> uses `process_direct_message()` function
   - ... etc.
4. Simplify `process_next()`:
   ```c
   void process_next(struct payload_buffer *buf) {
       struct payload *p = &buf->payloads[buf->process_base];
       p->process(p);  // That's it! No switch needed.
       buf->process_base++;
   }
   ```

### Benefits You will See
- No more repetitive switch statements in processing code.
- Behavior and data are together: Each payload is self-contained.
- Extensibility: Adding new operations (like `validate` or `to_json`) is
  straightforward.
- Separation of Concerns: Adding new types is easier, as it does not require
  lots of changes in process orchestrator. Just implement business logic in a
  function and assign it.

## What You will Learn
This exercise demonstrates the core principle of object-oriented programming:

> "Objects bundle data and behavior together, allowing them to be treated
> uniformly."

In C++/Java/Python, this is called *polymorphism* with virtual methods. In C,
we achieve the same thing with *function pointers*.

### Important Notes
- We are keeping this *simple*, just a few function pointers per payload.
- We are *not* building a full "virtual table" system yet. You will learn
  details of that in next milestones.
- Focus on understanding how function pointers enable polymorphic behavior.
- Later exercises will show more sophisticated patterns.

## Hints
- Keep your existing `payload_data` union structure
- Add a `void (*process)(struct payload *self)` function pointer to
  `struct payload`
- Create separate `process_login()`, `process_direct_message()`, etc. functions
- In `push_payload()`, after parsing, assign the appropriate function pointer
- Your `process_next()` becomes much simpler!

## Expected Outcome
Your code should:

- Handle all the same payloads as Exercise 01.
- Have no switch statements in `process_next()`.
- Be *easier to extend* with new payload types.
- Demonstrate how function pointers enable polymorphism.

After completing this, you'll understand why object-oriented languages use
virtual methods. They solve the exact same problem you just solved with
function pointers!

Up Next: After mastering simple function pointers, you will learn about more
advanced patterns like virtual tables (vtables) that store multiple function
pointers, enabling even richer polymorphic behavior.
