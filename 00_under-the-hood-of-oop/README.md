By building an interface in C first, you will realize that classes in object
oriented languages are not doing anything magical, they are just providing
*syntactic sugar* for patterns that are tedious to write in C.

# Under the Hood of OOP: Manual Object Interface
In this introductory module, the goal is to simulate an interface and
polymorphism using C programming langulage.

We shall start by explaining what is polymorphism.

## What is Polymorphism? (The "Many Forms" Principle)
In C, functions are usually bound at compile-time. If you call
`calculate_circle_area()`, the compiler knows exactly which memory address to
jump to. Polymorphism breaks this static link.

Polymorphism allows a single interface to represent different underlying
implementations. E.g. in your C code, this means you can hold a pointer to a
generic shape struct, but when you call `area(shape)`, the program decides at
*runtime* whether to execute the circle logic or the square logic.

## Function Pointers: Pillar of Dynamic Dispatch
In C, a function pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of a
function. This allows you to decide *at runtime* which function to call.

Its syntax is a bit messy but you will get it after writing a few function
pointers.

**Basic Syntax:**
```c
// Declaring a function pointer
double (*operation)(double, double);

// Assigning a function to it
double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
operation = add;

// Calling through the pointer
double result = operation(5.0, 3.0);  // Calls add(5.0, 3.0)
```

We put parenthesis to distinguish return type from function pointer syntax:
```c
// concate_arays variable is a pointer to a function that returns an int pointer
int *(*concate_arays)(int *arr1, int *arr2, int size1, int size2);
```

The key insight: **function pointers let you treat functions as variable**. You
can pass them around, store them in structs, and decide which one to call based
on runtime conditions.

reference for function pointers.

Enough introduction. Now you need to implement a dynamic dispatch logic to
practice OOP logic - [with what you have already known](./milestone-1.md).
